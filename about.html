                    This narrative visualization is based on a dataset compiled by Kaggle user
                    James Ko. It contains numerous attributes for each gun related incident
                    recorded by the Gun Violence Archive. The purpose of the visualization is
                    to highlight states and demographics most affected by gun violence.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The visualization is implemented as an interactive slideshow. Each scene is
                    embedded in a separate slide with pagination. As a user progresses through
                    the slideshow, the level of detail and interactivity increases. The
                    slideshow attempts to steer users towards a shared conclusion. However, the
                    interactive nature of each scene allows users to arrive at their own
                    conclusions as well.

                <p>
                    The scenes in the visualization use a shared template for visual
                    consistency. All three scenes are the same overall size, use uniform axes
                    and share the same fonts and color scheme.

                    1. Gun Violence in the United States (2013-2017)
                </p>
                <p>
                    A bar chart with state abbreviations in the x-axis and total number of
                    incidents in the y-axis. An annotation brings attention to the bar with the
                    highest number of incidents and tooltips are available for viewing
                    additional details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Yearly Incidents
                </p>
                <p>
                    A line chart with year in the x-axis and total number of incidents in the
                    y-axis. A dropdown menu is available to cycle through state names.
                    Selecting a state results in a transition of the plotted data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Participant Demographics (2013-2017)
                </p>
                <p>
                    A stacked bar chart with age groups in the x-axis and total number of
                    participants in y-axis. Gender and participation categories are available
                    in a legend. Selecting a category filters the data and triggers a
                    transition of the bars. Tooltips are available for viewing additional
                    details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Annotations</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first scene, a fixed annotation is used to highlight the high number
                    of gun related incidents in the state of Illinois. The annotation cannot be
                    cleared and is simply intended to set the tone for the scene that follows.
                    My intention was to highlight the state of Illinois in the first scene and
                    begin the second scene with Illinois as the default selection. There would
                    be additional annotations to highlight the increase of violence in recent
                    years. An unexpected issue late in the project prevented me from including
                    these annotations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Parameters</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several parameters throughout the narrative visualization. The
                    scene template includes slide numbers that are used to navigate through
                    scenes. In the second scene there are states listed in a dropdown menu. In
                    the final scene there are demographic categories that can be toggled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Triggers</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a slide number gets selected, the page transitions to the default
                    graph of the corresponding scene. If a user navigates to the second scene
                    they are presented with data for Illinois. Choosing a different state from
                    the dropdown will result in an animation plotting data for that state. Upon
                    navigating to the third scene, the user is presented with full stacked
                    bars. Toggling options form the legend results in an animation that subsets
                    those stacks.

                    <strong>Interface</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second and third scenes encourage users to interact with the
                    visualizations by prompting them to make selections. <q>Select State</q> and
                    <q>Select Group to Filter</q> draw attention to the area of each scene that
                    allows users to modify their current view of the data.
